About Manim
-----------

Manim is a powerful animation engine designed for creating 
**explanatory math videos**.
It is widely used to create videos similar to those of 3Blue1Brown,
but it can also be applied to other domains that require precise
and visually appealing animations.

There are mainly **two versions** of Manim:

- `3b1b/manim <https://github.com/3b1b/manim>`__
  
  Maintained by Grant Sanderson of 3Blue1Brown.

  - Uses **OpenGL** and its **GLSL language** to leverage the GPU.
  - Offers higher efficiency, faster rendering, and real-time interaction.
  - Best suited for high-quality production-ready videos.

- `ManimCommunity/manim <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim>`__
  
  Maintained by the Manim Community Development Team.

  - Uses multiple backend rendering options.
  - Provides better documentation and open contribution workflow.
  - Ideal for learners and educators.
